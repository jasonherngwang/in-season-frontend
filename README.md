In Season is an app for checking what fruits and vegetables are in season right now. There's a Basket feature that serves as a shopping list. Initial data is for Southern California, but with an account you can customize food details.

I built this app in Launch School, between the Core and Capstone phases. My goal was to use Just-in-Time Learning to pick up a handful of tools and concepts, and integrate them into a personal project. I wrote about my experience here:
